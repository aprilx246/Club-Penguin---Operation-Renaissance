# Club Penguin: Operation Renaissance
This is my progress on making a single game for every secret agent mission ever played on Club Penguin
To play the game, open up quests/q0/quest.swf in your favourite Flash player.

# Cassie's update - 22-09-23

Few changes today:
 * I've added the music to both the pizza parlour and coffee shop, whilst this is toggleable it's only from the code and not a button on the screen yet
 * I've added the penguins to start the hide and seek mission and a few of the Puffles but the functionality of them is low
 * I added a box in the top right to show which mission you are currently partaking in, I'm not a big fan of how it looks however so I may change this at a later date. For now it's pretty good for bug fixing though
